* Notes
- [ ] need to write tests for the pages
- [ ] made the routing work for the home and shop
  - [ ] might have to refactor to make it more clear
  - I still don't have an idea of what the page should look
    - thinking of making
- [ ] I might need to add a footer component
- [ ] how do we keep track of the page current active?
* What to do
- I need to import to create some object that keeps track of the items in the shop, with all the proper details
  - I could create an Items component which has the items object and an item component which create the boxes for individual items
- the Item component needs to show the item and include another component for adjusting the number of items
  - we can make this something that is controlled in the cart

* Pages
** ideas
- the project would be for buying ethiopian products
- it will be similar to the [[https://ethiopianspices.com/][ethiopian spices page]]
