* What to do
- Make a way to adjust the number of items to add to the cart

- I need to import to create some object that keeps track of the items in the shop, with all the proper details
  - I could create an Items component which has the items object and an item component which create the boxes for individual items
- the Item component needs to show the item and include another component for adjusting the number of items
  - we can make this something that is controlled in the cart
- i need to pass the item with the price and quantity
    - if the item exists in the array, increase the quantity
