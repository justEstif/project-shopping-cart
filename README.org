* Project: Shopping Cart

** Steps

1. create-react-app -> remove boilerplate
2. think about the component and the folder structure
3. create at least two pages -> homepage and shop page + shopping cart
   - navigation between routes with a navigation bar
4. to the home page add whatever you like. some images + info will be enough
   - its main purpose is for practice routing using ~react-router-dom~
5. on the shopping care route,
   - the user should see a sticky bar displays the number of items currently in the cart
   - there should also be a next button for checkout
6. build individual card items for each of your products build individual card items for each of your products
   - display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items that they want to buy.
   - add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning
   - you can also display a title for each product as well as an "Add to Cart" button
7. the amount on the cart should adjust after add to cart button clicked
8. make sure to test thoroughly using the react testing library
9. deploy -> read [[https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages][how to deploy react application with client side routing to github pages]] -> read [[https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6#router][react router docs for why you should provide a basename to the BrowserRouter]]
