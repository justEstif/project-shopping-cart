* Project: Shopping Cart

* Steps: [4/9]

1. [X] create-react-app -> remove boilerplate
2. [X] think about the component and the folder structure
3. [X] create at least two pages -> shop page + shopping cart
   - [X] navigation between routes with a navigation bar
4. [X] add some purchase items in the shop page
5. [ ] on the shopping care route,
   - [ ] the number of items currently in cart should be seen the the stick bar
   - [ ] there should be a next button for checkout
6. [ ] build individual card items for each of your products
   - [ ] display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items that they want to buy.
   - [ ] add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning
   - [ ] you can also display a title for each product as well as an "Add to Cart" button
7. [ ] the amount on the cart should adjust after add to cart button clicked
8. [ ] make sure to test thoroughly using the react testing library
9. [ ] deploy -> read [[https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages][how to deploy react application with client side routing to github pages]] -> read [[https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6#router][react router docs for why you should provide a basename to the BrowserRouter]]
